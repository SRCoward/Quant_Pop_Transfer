MPhil Mini Project 2: Simulating a Quantum Algorithm for Population Transfer via Non-Ergodic Extended States for Molecular Dynamics

Here is where I shall develop the second mini project on using the quantum population transfer protocol as a subprocess of a quantum parallel tempering algorithm. 

Main Reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04792.pdf

The report should contain the following:

I. An introduction to quantum computing and its applications in chemistry, as well as comments on the current capabilities of existing hardware. 						       [15%] 

II. A description of the Population Transfer protocol and how it can be used as a subroutine for quantum parallel tempering, as well as a description of the Trotter decomposition techniques used  to simulate the quantum algorithm.								        [15%]

III. Results will be presented for the technique applied to a particular problem Hamiltonian, which includes pairwise interactions, to be selected upon further analysis of the scope of the algorithm. We will use histograms to compare the frequency with which energy eigenstates are located via PT and alternative classical techniques. 								        [30%]

IV. Conclusions and future outlook								        [10%]

V. List of References										          [5%]
